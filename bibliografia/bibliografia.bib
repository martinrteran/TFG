abstract = {Abstract Thermionic energy converters are solid-state heat engines that have the potential to produce electricity with efficiencies of over 30\% and area-specific power densities of 100 Wcm−2. Despite this prospect, no prototypes reported in the literature have achieved true efficiencies close to this target, and many of the most recent investigations report power densities on the order of mWcm−2 or less. These discrepancies stem in part from the low-temperature (<1300 K) test conditions used to evaluate these devices, the large vacuum gap distances (25–100 µm) employed by these devices, and material challenges related to these devices' electrodes. This review will argue that, for feasible electrode work functions available today, efficient performance requires generating output power densities of >1 Wcm−2 and employing emitter temperatures of 1300 K or higher. With this result in mind, this review provides an overview of historical and current design architectures and comments on their capacity to realize the efficiency and power potential of thermionic energy converters. Also emphasized is the importance of using standardized efficiency metrics to report thermionic energy converter performance data.},

abstract = {Summary
Despite the relevance of thermophotovoltaic (TPV) conversion to many emerging energy technologies, identifying which aspects of current TPV designs are favorable and where opportunities for improvement remain is challenging because of the experimental variability in TPV literature, including emitter and cell temperatures, cavity geometry, and system scale. This review examines several decades of experimental TPV literature and makes meaningful comparisons across TPV reports by comparing each energy-conversion step to its respective, experiment-specific thermodynamic limit. We find that peak reported efficiencies are nearing 50\% of their thermodynamic limit. Emitter-cell pairs that best manage the broad spectrum of thermal radiation exhibit the best efficiencies. Large gains in peak efficiency are expected from further suppression of sub-bandgap radiative transfer, as well as improvements in carrier management that address bandgap underutilization and Ohmic losses. Furthermore, there is a noticeable practical gap between the leading material pairs and integrated devices, mainly due to a lack of scaled-up high-performance materials, which exposes surfaces to parasitic heat loss. Provided these challenges are overcome, TPVs may ultimately provide power on demand and near the point of use, enabling greater integration of intermittent renewables.}
