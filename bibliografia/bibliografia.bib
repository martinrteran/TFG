abstract = {Abstract Thermionic energy converters are solid-state heat engines that have the potential to produce electricity with efficiencies of over 30\% and area-specific power densities of 100 Wcm−2. Despite this prospect, no prototypes reported in the literature have achieved true efficiencies close to this target, and many of the most recent investigations report power densities on the order of mWcm−2 or less. These discrepancies stem in part from the low-temperature (<1300 K) test conditions used to evaluate these devices, the large vacuum gap distances (25–100 µm) employed by these devices, and material challenges related to these devices' electrodes. This review will argue that, for feasible electrode work functions available today, efficient performance requires generating output power densities of >1 Wcm−2 and employing emitter temperatures of 1300 K or higher. With this result in mind, this review provides an overview of historical and current design architectures and comments on their capacity to realize the efficiency and power potential of thermionic energy converters. Also emphasized is the importance of using standardized efficiency metrics to report thermionic energy converter performance data.},

abstract = {Industrial waste heat is examined in EU countries, focusing on the amount that can be recovered and exploited, referred to as technical potential of waste heat. An alternative methodology is proposed here, which is based on waste heat fractions derived from a detailed study of the UK industry from the period 2000–2003. These fractions express the part of heat consumption that is wasted and is possible to be recovered. The waste heat fractions have been calculated in this work for each main industrial sector and temperature level. The methodology initially includes the adjustment of waste heat fractions from each industrial sector from the UK industry to the conditions of the different EU countries in the period 2000–2003, in order to account for the different levels of energy efficiency. The second step is to adjust the fractions for the year 2015, using data about the evolution of energy intensity values from 2000 to 2003 to 2015 for each country and sector, resulting to a new set of fractions per country, temperature level and sector. This methodology has enabled the authors to study in detail the waste heat potential per sector and temperature level, using the most recent data. The main outcome is the estimation of waste heat potential for each main industrial sector in the EU, broken down to the amount of waste heat for each temperature range. A similar analysis is conducted for each EU country as well, in order to identify the magnitude of heat recovery opportunities that could exist for every industrial sector at country level. The main result of this analysis is the estimation of the total waste heat potential in EU, which is about 300 TWh/year, with one third corresponding to temperature level below 200 °C, which is often referred to as low-temperature waste heat, another 25\% in the range 200–500 °C and the rest above 500 °C (mostly in the range 500–1000 °C). The findings of the current study can be used for assessing the potential of any relevant heat recovery applications, such as heat upgrade and re-use or heat-to-power conversion technologies.}

	abstract = {Thermophotovoltaics (TPVs) convert predominantly infrared wavelength light to electricity via the photovoltaic effect, and can enable approaches to energy storage1,2 and conversion3–9 that use higher temperature heat sources than the turbines that are ubiquitous in electricity production today. Since the first demonstration of 29\% efficient TPVs (Fig. 1a) using an integrated back surface reflector and a tungsten emitter at 2,000 °C (ref. 10), TPV fabrication and performance have improved11,12. However, despite predictions that TPV efficiencies can exceed 50\% (refs. 11,13,14), the demonstrated efficiencies are still only as high as 32\%, albeit at much lower temperatures below 1,300 °C (refs. 13–15). Here we report the fabrication and measurement of TPV cells with efficiencies of more than 40\% and experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of high-bandgap tandem TPV cells. The TPV cells are two-junction devices comprising III–V materials with bandgaps between 1.0 and 1.4 eV that are optimized for emitter temperatures of 1,900–2,400 °C. The cells exploit the concept of band-edge spectral filtering to obtain high efficiency, using highly reflective back surface reflectors to reject unusable sub-bandgap radiation back to the emitter. A 1.4/1.2 eV device reached a maximum efficiency of (41.1 ± 1)\% operating at a power density of 2.39 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,400 °C. A 1.2/1.0 eV device reached a maximum efficiency of (39.3 ± 1)\% operating at a power density of 1.8 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,127 °C. These cells can be integrated into a TPV system for thermal energy grid storage to enable dispatchable renewable energy. This creates a pathway for thermal energy grid storage to reach sufficiently high efficiency and sufficiently low cost to enable decarbonization of the electricity grid.},

abstract = {The thermal conductivities of silicon and germanium have been determined using the non-stationary hot wire method. Measurements were carried out over the temperature range 293–1724K on solid and liquid silicon and on liquid germanium in alumina tube. For solid silicon, the thermal conductivities were about 139W/mK at 293K and 19W/mK at 1573K and displayed temperature dependence steeper than T−1, where T is the temperature. Calculation of thermal conductivities for solid silicon based upon isotope, three-phonon and four-phonon scatterings indicates that phonon conduction dominates heat conduction at temperatures below 1000K. At temperatures above 1000K, on the contrary, contributions from electron, hole and electron–hole pair to heat conduction became greater progressively with a temperature rise. For liquid silicon, the thermal conductivity was about 57W/mK at 1700K and exhibited a slight increase with an increase in temperature. The thermal conductivity of liquid germanium was about 43W/mK at 1273K and slightly increased with increasing temperature. In both liquids, temperature dependency of thermal conductivity values was discussed from the view point of the Wiedemann–Franz law.}

	abstract = {Amorphous SiO2 (a-SiO2) thin films are widely used in integrated circuits (ICs) due to their excellent thermal stability and insulation properties. In this paper, the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2 thin film was systematically investigated using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. In addition to the size effect and the temperature effect for thermal conductivity of a-SiO2 thin films, the effect of defects induced thermal conductivity tuning was also examined. It was found that the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2 thin films is insensitive to the temperature from −55 °C to 150 °C. Nevertheless, in the range of the thickness in this work, the thermal conductivity of the crystalline SiO2 (c-SiO2) thin films conforms to the T−α with the exponent range from −0.12 to −0.37, and the thinner films are less sensitive to temperature. Meanwhile, the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2 with thickness beyond 4.26 nm has no significant size effect, which is consistent with the experimental results. Compared with c-SiO2 thin film, the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2 is less sensitive to defects. Particularly, the effect of spherical void defects on the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2 is followed by Coherent Potential model, which is helpful for the design of low-K material based porous a-SiO2 thin film in microelectronics.},

abstract = {Summary
Despite the relevance of thermophotovoltaic (TPV) conversion to many emerging energy technologies, identifying which aspects of current TPV designs are favorable and where opportunities for improvement remain is challenging because of the experimental variability in TPV literature, including emitter and cell temperatures, cavity geometry, and system scale. This review examines several decades of experimental TPV literature and makes meaningful comparisons across TPV reports by comparing each energy-conversion step to its respective, experiment-specific thermodynamic limit. We find that peak reported efficiencies are nearing 50\% of their thermodynamic limit. Emitter-cell pairs that best manage the broad spectrum of thermal radiation exhibit the best efficiencies. Large gains in peak efficiency are expected from further suppression of sub-bandgap radiative transfer, as well as improvements in carrier management that address bandgap underutilization and Ohmic losses. Furthermore, there is a noticeable practical gap between the leading material pairs and integrated devices, mainly due to a lack of scaled-up high-performance materials, which exposes surfaces to parasitic heat loss. Provided these challenges are overcome, TPVs may ultimately provide power on demand and near the point of use, enabling greater integration of intermittent renewables.}
